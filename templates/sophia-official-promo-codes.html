    <h1>Sophia official promo codes</h1>

    <p>
      This page tracks <strong>official Sophia promotions</strong> — discounts run directly by Sophia Learning.
      These offers are different from referral codes and may not always be available.
    </p>

    <div class="note">
      If no official promo is active, the most common alternative is a
      <a href="/">Sophia referral code</a>, which typically gives new users $20 off their first month.
    </div>

    <h2>Current official Sophia promotions</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <strong>Status:</strong> No public official promo confirmed right now<br />
      <span style="color:#94a3b8;">
        Sophia does not always run public promotions. When one appears, it is usually limited-time and
        announced via email or landing pages.
      </span>
    </div>

    <h2>Official promo vs referral code</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Official promo:</strong> Run by Sophia, limited-time, may offer % or fixed discounts</li>
        <li><strong>Referral code:</strong> Shared by users, usually $20 off first month (new accounts)</li>
        <li><strong>Stacking:</strong> Usually not allowed</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Which discount should you use?</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <p>
        If an official Sophia promo is active, it may provide a larger discount.
        Otherwise, referral codes are generally the most reliable option for new users.
      </p>
      <p>
        👉 See currently available referral options on the
        <a href="/">Sophia referral codes page</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Important notes</h2>

    <div class="card">
      <ul>
        <li>Official promos can start and end without notice</li>
        <li>Eligibility rules may change</li>
        <li>Always verify discounts during checkout</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
